# Hangman
I created this hangman game to practice some of the concepts I learned while completing Microsoft's Foundational C# certification. 

The game has the option for two players to play against each other, or for one player to play against the computer. I used CrypticWizard's random word generator to generate words as the computer. The program regulates input and has checks in place to avoid any errors the user may cause (such as inputting too many letters, symbols, capital/lowercase, etc). 

Created using .NET version 7.0.401
